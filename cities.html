                    <b>Svendborg</b><br><br>
                    With a lovely harbor full of sleek yachts and old fishermen’s boats, Svendborg is set on a lovely fjord and is the 
                    gateway to the spectacular archipelago of Funen. Dotted alongside the more modern parts of the city are quaint cafes
                    and nice restaurants, as well as some peaceful cycling paths.<br>With pretty beaches that are especially popular in
                    summer, and regular ferries to nearby islands, Svendborg is a laidback place to spend some time.
